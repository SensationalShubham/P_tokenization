# ERC 721 
These type of contracts are used in making NFTs(non-fungible tokens). ERC721 itself has various types like Total supply, Mintable, Burnable etc.


Basic difference between ERC20 and ERC721 is that ERC20 is used for fungible tokens like Bitcoin but ERC721 is for Non-fungible meaning only one with unique attributes. 

I made this project for sharpening my solidity skills and think of it like a skeleton for ERC contracts.

## How AI helped me?
As we know AI is taking jobs day by day in today's world so a developer's job is to find out how one can take advantage of it. 
* I took advantage by using it as my guide all the time 

I asked Bard (Chat bot by Google) to tell me what is ERC contracts, what's their use and tell it to make a heirarchy of what it includes.

* NOTE: I didn't copy paste even a single LOC from Bard, it's purely made by me.

 I instructed Bard to focus on Important concepts and teach them to me, telling my mistakes in my code etc.
